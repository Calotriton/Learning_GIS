    "In this new notebook about learning GIS, we will dive into data selection based on spatial relationships. When working with geospatial data, you often need to do specific GIS operations based on how the data layers are located in relation to each other. For instance, finding out if a certain point is located inside an area, or whether a line intersects with another line or a polygon, are very common operations for selecting data based on spatial location.\n",
    "\n",
    "These kind of queries are commonly called as **spatial queries**. Spatial queries are conducted based on the topological spatial relations which are fundamental constructs that describe how two or more geometric objects relate to each other concerning their position and boundaries. Topological spatial relations can be exemplified by relationships such as contains, touches and intersects. In GIS, the topological relations play a crucial role as they enable queries that are less concerned with the exact coordinates or shapes of geographic entities but more focused on their relative arrangements and positions.
